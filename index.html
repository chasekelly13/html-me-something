                    I started off my employment history in 2015 at a local golf shop, Shadow Valley Country Club. I worked the front desk and was thrilled to help the members every day. I would go from setting tee times, to managing inventory, as well as assist the golf pro with the tournaments that we would host. As a worked there I gained additional responsibilities like opening and closing the golf shop when the golf pro was out. I also got to enjoy free golf on my days off which was a huge plus to the job and reinvigorated my love for the game.

                    Having a lifelong passion for learning and wanting to share that with others my next job as a tutor was perfect. In my sophomore year of college at the University of Arkansas, I was approached by one of my advisors about the opportunity to join a local tutoring company where I could make help other college students with classes I had already taken as well as make come extra money in the process. Getting to interact with other college students and help them improve their grades was extremely rewarding and a big reason why I had this job alongside my golf shop one throughout college.

                    After I graduated college, I looked to find a full-time job that could gain me valuable experience in the business world. I found a position as a quality control specialist with a H & R Block Franchise. I was hired on to do quality control for tax returns to guarantee that returns were done accurately and done so the client received the biggest return they were eligible for. Not only was I entrusted to protect the company as well as our clients from potential audits, I also filled in as the front desk attendant while the main receptionist was off. I worked at H & R Block in Centerton, Arkansas for 2 different seasons in 2019 as well as in 2020.

                    After my two stints with H & R Block, I wanted to find a full-time job that would be permanent and not just during the tax season. Luckily, I was able to find a position with Hewlett-Packard as a Project Specialist in 2020. I am tasked with creating orders for our customers as well as manage inventory to make sure our corporate clients have the necessary products in our warehouse ready to be shipped to them when they request it. Being able to communicate with our clients and meet their demands is a rewarding job, but not my passion as I like to think analytically, and problem solve.

                     After being accepted into Launch Codeâ€™s Code Academy 101 in 2020, I started my coding adventure. I have started learning JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS. As I stated earlier business administration, even though that is the degree I got and the job I have, is not my passion. I am far more invested into coding and want to be a life-long coding nerd wherever this passion takes me.
